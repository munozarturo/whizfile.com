## Enforcing Constraints With Lambda

### Trigger

```text
S3: whizfile-transfers
arn:aws:s3:::whizfile-transfers
Details
Bucket arn: arn:aws:s3:::whizfile-transfers
Event types: s3:ObjectCreated:Put
Notification name: 2640f6bc-42ab-436b-a1be-18827c3078f7
Service principal: s3.amazonaws.com
Source account: 136562502667
Statement ID: lambda-cff86cfa-f686-4fde-9cfc-b235c3fb550d
```

### Code

```Python
import json
import boto3
from urllib.parse import unquote_plus

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # get the size of the file that was PUT
    object_size: int = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['size']
    max_size: int = 1000000000
    
    # Extract the bucket name
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']

    # Extract the object key (file name)
    # The key may be URL-encoded, so it's important to decode it
    object_key = unquote_plus(event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key'])
    
    print(f"Invoked on: {bucket_name}::{object_key} [{object_size}]")
    
    # if the file size is greater than the max allowed
    if object_size > max_size:
        print(f"Attempting delete: {bucket_name}::{object_key} [{object_size}]")
        
        s3_client.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key)
        
        print(f"Deleted: {bucket_name}::{object_key} [{object_size}]")
```

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Policy

In S3 Bucket `permissions` under CORS.

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT",
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```
